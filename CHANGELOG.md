# Ember Paper Changelog

### 1.0.0

#### Migrating from releases prior to 1.0

Version 1.0 introduces many API changes relative to previous releases. In addition to the specific changelog listing below, the follow general changes have been made. Note that during the development of 1.0, the `wip/v1.0.0` branch reflects the most up-to-date version, with a mixture of updated and to-be-updated components.

Contributions and pull requests are always welcome. Contributors may often be found on the slack.com #e-paper channel. Building the dummy application by installing `ember-paper` as if it were an application will provide you an up-to-date interactive demo, templates, and code samples.

- Attributes are now `camelCased` rather than `kebob-cased`.
- Components which accept user input, such as `paper-input`, `paper-checkbox`, `paper-switch` and `paper-select` now receive their input via the one-way `value` attribute and notify of a changed value by the `onChange` actions.
- When provided by the API, `onChange` actions are required and throw an assertion if not provided.
- Actions maybe be specified by a string action name (`onChange="updateValue"`) or an action closure (`onChange=(action (mut "myValue"))`). If you need to specify a target or additional parameter, you must use an action closure.
- Many attributes have been renamed for clarity and consistency. See the specific changes below.
- `paper-icon`'s `size` attribute now takes a size in pixels, and `lg` or `sm` values are no longer supported.
- renamed the `paper-radio-group` `paper-radio` to just `radio` -- usage would now be `group.radio` as opposed to `group.paper-radio`.
